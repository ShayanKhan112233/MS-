                One day, a dog stole a piece of meat from a butcher<br> shop and ran off with it. On his way home, he had<br> to cross a river, and when he looked down at the <br>water,The dog was so pleased with his find that<br> he ran to the river to admire his reflection in the<br> water. As he gazed into the water, he saw another<br> dog with a larger bone in his mouth. The greedy<br> dog wanted that bone too and foolishly snapped<br> at the image in the water, he saw his own reflection<br> with the meat in its mouth. Thinking that another <br>dog had a bigger piece of meat, he foolishly jumped<br> into the river to take it for himself. As he opened his <br>mouth to grab the meat, he lost his own piece to the<br> river's current. The dog went home hungry,<br> losing his stolen meat due to greed.
