        <div><p class="h4">In a calm village, there was a smart crow named Cleo. <br>One super hot day, Cleo got thirsty, just like everyone<br> else. But the village well had a small opening, making<br> it hard for Cleo to drink water.

            Cleo saw a pitcher near<br> a house, but it had a small neck, and she couldnâ€™t<br> reach the water. Luckily, she found some small stones.<br> Cleo had an idea. She picked up the stones and<br> dropped them into the pitcher, one by one. Each<br> stone made the water level go up. Cleo kept doing<br> this until the water was high enough for her to take<br> a nice drink.
            
            The villagers saw how clever Cleo was<br> and gathered around, impressed by her smart move.<br> The story of the smart crow spread throughout the <br>village, and everyone felt inspired.
            
            After drinking <br>and impressing the villagers, Cleo flew away.<br> Her story taught everyone, especially the <br>students, that even tricky problems can <br>be solved with a bit of creative thinking.</p></div>
